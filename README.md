# User Experience UX

## UX-strategy

The goal is to provide a simple website that allows users to pass the time playing simple browser based games. 

**Developer Goals**

The website provides a means to develop coding and programming skills and potential future monitiosation through advertising. The MVP of this project is simple but the site can be developed to include additional games and to include more complex java script to improve the first game Hangman. 

**User Goals**

- Entertainment.
- Relaxation.
- Challenge.
- Pass the time.
- Play for free.

**User Stories**

_As a FIRST TIME user of the site I want to be able to:_
- Intuitively and easily navigate the site
- Intuitively be able to play the game/games
- Find help or instruction if nessicary
- Play the games on a mobile device without the need for any additional downloads. 

_As a RETURNING user of the site I want to be able to:_
- Easily navifate to my favourite game
- Send feedback and ideas for more games to the website owner

## UX-scope

**Hangman game - Generating words**
  1. Create a list of words and hints in an array.
  2. Create approx 5 category buttons, each button would call on its own array of words. The hint is implied by the category choosen but a hint could also be included. 
  3. Find an API to automatically generate words.

Pro to the first option is the simplicity of the idea, easy to excectute and impliment. 
Con is that it is limiting for the player as extended play may make them famililar with 
the range of words. Second option similarly is simple to excecute but potentially also limiting for the player. The second option does has the added benefit for the player to allow them to choose the category of word they wish to play with. The third option extends the potential logevity of the game as there would be a much wider number of possible words. To this point I havent been able to find one that could also provide a hint rather than a definition to the player. Without a hint the game maybe too difficult but with a definition too easy.
