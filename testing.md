## Jest

I considered using jest to test my project but in the end decided that I would manually test on this occasion and practice using jest on another project using a strictly test driven development approach and red, green, refactor. On this project I kept jumping to the code I believed was the solution and I felt I needed to slow down and practice with Jest before using for a milestone/time sensitive project.

## Lighthouse Audit

![Index](assets/images/testing/Lighthouse%20Audit%20-%20index.png)

When I initially ran the lighthouse audit there were two issues that I deemed significant but resolvable issues
1. Meta description. While this isn't really necessary for this project I felt it would be best practice to add. 
2. No label for the input box on the Maths game for accessibility purposes. 

![Final Lighthouse Audit - Maths game](assets/images/testing/Final-lighthouse-maths.png)

When I ran a final lighthouse audit prior to submission there was a best practice error originating from the minified jQuery mobile code.

Some additional improvements to performance could be made, reducing the image size and number of scripts to improve the load time.
   
## Compliant Code

[W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

All pages of HTML pass through the validator without any issues.

[CSS validator Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![CSS](assets/images/testing/css.png)

No errors were returned when the css was passed through the validator by direct input.

[JavaScript linter](https://www.jslint.com/)

I used JSLint to validate my Javascript, initially the level of warnings returned was very high mainly concerned with the use of single quotes instead of double quotes and alphabetical order in objects. On reviewing the functionality I discovered that I could 'allow' parameters to the check. This then reduced the warnings to a reviewable level. I had instances of additional semi colons in the code which I removed and I had incorrectly used continue in a for loop. jsLint continues to show high levels of warnings such as document undeclared and $ undeclared. I concluded that the remaining errors should not be considered due to them referring to the DOM and/or other libraries or scripts. I reviewed the warnings with my Mentor who was in agreement with my conclusion with one exception I have missed a let in a loop, which I corrected. 

[JSHint](jshint.com)

Prior to submitting, while completing the checklist for myself an additional validator which I passed my JS thorugh to be careful. I was satifised and reassured by the results. 

## Bugs

|**Bug**|**Resolution**|
|-----|-----|
|sendMail|I encountered a bug, truthfully I made an error when setting up the sendMail function. I now cannot remember what it was or how I fixed it so the lesson I have learnt is to improve the notes I write to myself on bugs I encounter during the development process. I added the alert to the user as part of the fix.|
|Correctly guessed letters not displaying in the correct position|I had forgotten to include the li items used in the Nav when I calculated the code for displayGuessedLetters|
|Unused page called mole.html displaying on every button press|I missed a closing angle bracket on a holding nav item|
|Hangman game whilst responsive to the screen size was unplayable due to the small buttons and word display| refactored the code to ensure word and the buttons displayed correctly on small screens and remained playable|
|Maths game submitting empty field|As I had an autofocus on the input field the maths game was submitting empty fields when the win or loss screens were displayed. I tried adding a required field to the input which didnâ€™t work. To solve the problem I amended the event listener to not run check answer when the field was empty|
